Current Workflow:

  1. Ecologists visually analyze images of individuals.
  2. Based on this analysis, they manually input values for over 100 parameters, such as ear shape and presence of tusks, into a system.
  3. The system utilizes these inputs to generate a probabilistic score for individual identification.

Automation Approach:

  1. Analyze images using various deep learning techniques.
  2. Extract relevant features automatically.
  3. Provide accurate input data to the existing scoring system.
