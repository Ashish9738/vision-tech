# I identify as an Individual 

### Problem Statement
Imagine a team of dedicated wildlife researchers struggling to identify individual elephants from countless photos. Currently, they meticulously analyze each image, noting specific features like tail markings or horn shape, by hand. This laborious process limits their ability to study larger populations.
This is where our research comes in. We're partnering with these ecologists to automate this classification process. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we'll leverage their expertise. They've identified a crucial set of features –  think fur patterns, whisker length, or unique markings – that act like an animal's fingerprint.
Our task? Building a powerful AI system using deep learning and computer vision. This system will analyze photos directly, automatically recognizing those key features identified by the ecologists. Essentially, it'll learn to "see" the same way the researchers do, but at lightning speed.
By automating feature extraction, we'll free up the researchers' time for more analysis and discovery. They can finally focus on the bigger picture, studying population trends and animal behavior with a newfound efficiency. This collaboration between cutting-edge AI and ecological expertise holds the potential to revolutionize how we study the natural world.


### Abstract
This research tackles the challenge of automating individual classification within a pre-existing framework where ecologist

Current Workflow:

  1. Ecologists visually analyze images of individuals.
  2. Based on this analysis, they manually input values for over 100 parameters, such as ear shape, presence of tusks and others into a system.
  3. The system utilizes these inputs to generate a probabilistic score for individual identification.

Automation Approach:

  1. Analyze images using various deep learning techniques.
  2. Extract relevant features automatically.
  3. Provide accurate input data to the existing scoring system.
